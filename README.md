# moodle-block_edureportbook
This plugin is an assistant to prepare an existing course
as a notebook for communication between parents and teachers.

The functionality of this plugin is independent from the
"[Parent role](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Parent_role)" as described
in the Moodle docs, which makes a relation between user accounts. In
contrast to this Parent role, this plugin works on the course level.

Using this plugin allows teachers to automatically create
one group per student and assign their parents as group members
in a very user friendly way.

Further, it helps teachers to create two forums that allow fluent
communication - one forum without groups for general communication,
and one forum with separated groups for private communication.
